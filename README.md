# Assignment-3: Fish Tank Temprature Probe

## Idea:
Creating an enclosure to hold the circuit outside a Fish Tank so that the temprature probe can be dipped in the water.

## Laser Cutting
Created a box using Illustrator and Laser Cutting

## 3D Printing
Used the 3D Printer to print Hooks to keep the device on the Glass edge of a Fish Tank
Used it to print another small hook to hold the Neopixel Matrix

## Extra I/O
Added a buzzer to notify the user that the temprature is above a threshold
